Rather than using a standard Pandas dataframe, we are going to use the RAPIDS equivalent, cuDF (CUDA dataframe). This loads the data into GPU memory rather than using the host system's RAM. As you will see, this opens up a new realm of possibilities because of the huge speed boost this can provide.\n",

Because we chose 5 as the number of nearest neighbours, we have a row value which represents the index of each node and then five columns containing the indexes of the 5 nearest nodes, with the nearest in column 0 and the furthest in column 4.
